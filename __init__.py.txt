"""
pv exposes a simple API to interface with some photovoltaic DC inverters via
RS-232.

pv was developed specifically for the Carbon Management Solutions CMS-2000
inverter, and is expected to work for the Solar Energy Australia Orion inverter
since they are essentially the same device with a different badge.

The communication protocol was based on examining the data exchange between
the inverter device and the official Pro Control 2.0.0.0 monitoring software
for the Orion inverter.
